# RiftCity V2 — Phase 3.2: Direct-Open City Locations

This build keeps the Phase 3.1 direct city hub and removes the extra location preview/enter step.

## Phase 3.2 behavior

- City locations are displayed directly in the City directory.
- Tapping/clicking any location immediately moves the player there and opens its location page.
- No inspector panel.
- No second **Open location** / **Enter location** button.
- Location routes use `#city/<location-id>` so browser back/forward and refresh work correctly.
- Directly opening a location route also syncs the player's persistent D1 location.
- Each location page has a **← City** link and an area ready for that location's future gameplay module.
- Existing world data, authentication, player state, D1 persistence, and developer logs are preserved.

## D1 setup

No new database migration is required for Phase 3.2.

## Current world scope

The location pages are navigation shells for now. Hospital, jail, shops, bank, casino, education, gym and other gameplay modules will be plugged into these pages in later phases.
