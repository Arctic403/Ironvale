# RiftCity V2 — Phase 4: Direct-Open City Locations

This build keeps the Phase 4.1 direct city hub and removes the extra location preview/enter step.

## Phase 4 behavior

- City locations are displayed directly in the City directory.
- Tapping/clicking any location immediately moves the player there and opens its location page.
- No inspector panel.
- No second **Open location** / **Enter location** button.
- Location routes use `#city/<location-id>` so browser back/forward and refresh work correctly.
- Directly opening a location route also syncs the player's persistent D1 location.
- Each location page has a **← City** link and an area ready for that location's future gameplay module.
- Existing world data, authentication, player state, D1 persistence, and developer logs are preserved.

## D1 setup

No new database migration is required for Phase 4.

## Cloudflare build settings

- Build command: `npm run build`
- Deploy command: `npx wrangler deploy`
- Root directory: repository root

## Current world scope

The location pages are navigation shells for now. Hospital, jail, shops, bank, casino, education, gym and other gameplay modules will be plugged into these pages in later phases.


## Phase 4: Item + Inventory Engine

Phase 4 adds a server-authoritative, generic inventory engine. Individual item definitions live in `src/items.js` as registry/config data so future items can be added without rewriting inventory mechanics.

Starter registry:
- First Aid Kit
- Knife
- Energy Drink
- Candy Bar
- Cheap Watch
- Screwdriver
- Key
- Ticket

New API routes:
- `GET /api/items`
- `GET /api/items/:id`
- `GET /api/inventory`
- `POST /api/inventory/use`
- `POST /api/inventory/equip`
- `POST /api/inventory/unequip`

The `player_inventory` D1 table self-creates on the first inventory request. `schema.sql` also contains the table for clean deployments.

The backend includes generic `addItemToInventory()` and `removeItemFromInventory()` helpers for future shops, crimes, rewards, drops and admin tools. They are intentionally not exposed as public grant endpoints.

## JavaScript-only architecture

This repository is intentionally JavaScript-only end to end:

- Cloudflare Worker/API: `src/*.js`
- Browser client: `public/*.js`
- Wrangler entry point: `src/index.js`
- No TypeScript source files, declaration files, `tsconfig`, TypeScript compiler, `ts-node`, `tsx`, or `@types/*` packages are required.
- `npm run build` runs a JS-only guard first and fails if TypeScript is introduced later.

Wrangler still bundles the Worker for Cloudflare deployment, but RiftCity's source code and project configuration remain JavaScript-only.

## Phase 5 — Server-authoritative crime engine

- Persistent D1 player crime mastery and attempt history.
- `GET /api/crimes` returns server-calculated availability/chances.
- `POST /api/crimes/execute` spends nerve and resolves success/failure entirely in the Worker.
- Cash, XP/level progress, item drops and jail/hospital consequences are committed server-side.
- Crime rewards write directly into the existing D1 inventory engine.
- Client JavaScript only renders the server result; it does not choose outcomes or reward amounts.

## Plugin architecture

Gameplay definitions now live under `src/plugins/` while `src/index.js` stays focused on generic server engines and persistence:

- `src/plugins/crimes.js` — crime definitions, requirements, reward pools, chances and consequence tuning.
- `src/plugins/items.js` — item definitions and item lookup/public-shape helpers.
- `src/plugins/world.js` — city categories, locations, tags, requirements and service descriptors.
- `src/plugins/index.js` — the single registry surface imported by the Worker.
- `src/items.js` remains as a compatibility re-export so older imports do not break.

This means content can be added/tuned without rewriting the generic crime, inventory, travel, D1, authentication or audit engines. Future systems such as shops, gyms, bank products, casino games, jobs and location services should follow the same plugin/config pattern when their engines are added.

### Crime result UI

Crime attempts now render their server result directly inside the crime card that was attempted. Successes, failures and blocked/error results stay attached to that crime and display reward/progression details without using the global toast as the result surface.



## Phase 6 — Massive server-authoritative backend foundation

The V1 feature build is now treated as a feature target, not as code to copy. Phase 6 rebuilds the reusable backend spine in JavaScript/Cloudflare/D1.

### New plugin families
- `jobs.js` — five career ladders and pay/skill tuning.
- `education.js` — timed courses, costs, level requirements and bonuses.
- `gym.js` — RiftCity's program-based gym progression.
- `banking.js` — checking/savings rules and investment tiers.
- `properties.js` — residence catalog and home bonuses.
- `factions.js` — faction identities and rank thresholds.
- `missions.js` — connected mission targets/rewards.
- `markets.js` — fictional RiftCity market assets/pricing.
- `events.js` — rotating world-event definitions.
- `shops.js` — location-aware store inventories and pricing.
- `casino.js` — in-game chip account/game catalog foundation; no real-money wagering.

### Persistent service engine
`src/services/gameplay.js` owns the generic D1-backed service engine. It creates/uses persistent tables for banking, investments, careers, education, gym progression, properties, factions, shared progression counters, missions, fictional market holdings, player auction listings and casino chips.

All service routes are authenticated:
- `GET /api/services` — installed service catalog.
- `GET /api/services/:service` — current catalog + player state for that system.
- `POST /api/services/:service` — execute a server-authoritative action.

Implemented service IDs:
`bank`, `jobs`, `education`, `gym`, `properties`, `factions`, `missions`, `market`, `shop`, `auction`, `status`, `events`, `casino`.

Important POST actions include:
- bank: `deposit`, `withdraw`, `to-savings`, `from-savings`, `invest`, `claim-investment`
- jobs: `join`, `work`
- education: `enroll`
- gym: `train`
- properties: `buy`, `set-home`
- factions: `join`, `work`, `leave`
- missions: `claim`
- market: `buy`, `sell`
- shop: `buy`, `sell`
- auction: `list`, `buy`, `cancel`
- casino: `claim-daily` (game implementations remain a later tuning pass)

Crime successes, city travel, job shifts, gym sessions, faction work and cash milestones now feed shared server-side progression counters used by missions. Existing crime/item/world engines remain intact.
